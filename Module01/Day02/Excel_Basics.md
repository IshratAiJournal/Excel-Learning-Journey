# 🧮 Microsoft Excel Practice – Getting Help, Rows & Columns, and Formatting

## 📘 Overview
This repository documents my learning progress and practical exercises from Microsoft Excel training.  
The lessons focus on **Getting Help in Excel**, **Working with Rows and Columns**, and **Formatting Text & Hyperlinks**.

## 🧠 1. Getting Help in Excel

Excel provides built-in help tools that make learning easy:

- Use the **Search box** in the title bar to ask for help (e.g., type “SUM”).
- Follow the help panel instructions to use **AutoSum** and calculate totals.
- Copy formulas down a column using **Ctrl + C** and **Ctrl + V**.
- Explore the **Help tab** in the ribbon to discover more built-in guides.

✅ *Goal:* Learn how to get help directly within Excel and apply it to your worksheet.

## 📊 2. Working with Rows and Columns

Excel’s grid structure allows flexible control over rows and columns.

**Key actions practiced:**
- **Resize columns:** Double-click between headers (e.g., between A and B) to auto-fit width.
- **Delete blank columns:** Right-click a column header → *Delete*.
- **Merge & Center titles:** Home → *Merge & Center* for cleaner headings.
- **Clear data:** Home → *Clear → Clear All* to remove values without deleting cells.
- **AutoFit all columns:** Home → *Format → AutoFit Column Width*.

✅ *Goal:* Improve the layout and readability of the worksheet.

## 🎨 3. Formatting Text and Creating Hyperlinks

Formatting helps make your data visually clear and professional.

### ✏️ Font Formatting
- Customize **font type, size, color**, and **style** (Bold, Italic, Underline).
- Use **Ctrl + 1** or *Right-click → Format Cells* to open advanced options.
- Apply **Format Painter** (Home → Format Painter) to copy styles quickly.

### 🔗 Hyperlinks
- Add hyperlinks using **Ctrl + K** or *Insert → Link*.
- Link to:
  - Websites (URLs)
  - Other sheets
  - Email addresses
  - Local documents
- Linked text turns **blue and underlined**.

✅ *Goal:* Make worksheets visually engaging and add interactive navigation.
